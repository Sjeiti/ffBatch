This is a helper web-app to use with the [Filter Forge](https://www.filterforge.com/) command line renderer.

The app is geared towards animating filter properties but it can also create files for rendering all the presets and/or render maps (diffuse, normal, bump). The resulting XML files can be downloaded as a zip and should be used with the Filter Forge command line binary.

This app is a rewrite of [an earlier PHP-based solution](https://www.filterforge.com/forum/read.php?PAGEN_1=1&FID=5&TID=6133&sphrase_id=4710101#nav_start). It was no longer working and things like that can be done solely client-side these days.
